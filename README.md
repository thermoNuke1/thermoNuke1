# 👋 Hi, I'm Carlo

Software Engineering student with a strong focus on backend systems, system architectures, developer tooling and infrastructure. I enjoy building designing and builiding systems that are observable, secure, and maintainable, and I care a lot about clean boundaries, good abstractions, and documentation that actually explains *why* things exist.

## 🧠 About Me

* 🎓 Software Engineering student (4th year)
* 💻 Backend‑leaning full‑stack developer
* 🔍 Interested in systems design, reliability, and infrastructure
* 📈 Strong interest in machine learning and mathmatical applications.

I tend to gravitate toward problems involving **architecture, correctness, and scale**, whether that’s designing service boundaries, building CI/CD pipelines, or reasoning about edge cases in distributed systems.
